# StarWars

# Technologies used üõ†Ô∏è

- [NodeJS] (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [RestAPIs] (https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/rest-apis)

# Clone and Use üìã

- The website is completely built on `node-js` library of `javascript` and that's why we need `nodejs` and `npm` installed
- While installing `nodejs` and `npm`, try to install versions which are equal or greater than the versions mentioned in badges above
- In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page
- After the successful installation of `nodejs` and `npm`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhranil08/StarWars.git
  ```
  This will clone the whole repository in your system.
- To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command:
  ```node
  npm install
  ```
- Now the project is ready to use
- You can check it using `npm start`, it will open the website locally on your browser.
- PORT number in server.js to use your own. Ex : local URL - http://localhost:3000/ , when PORT number : 3000
- **Just for this assignment no DB used, instead a global hashmap is being for processing favourites. Can update to use DB if asked or needed.**
